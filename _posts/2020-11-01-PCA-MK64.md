# Introduction

Many of you have probably played Mario Kart 64, and each of you has a favorite character! I always played with Wario, which is certainly the best one ðŸ˜Š.
{: .text-justify}
In this game, we have 8 characters from the Nintendo franchise: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Wario and Bowser. In general, we have the subdivision between light karts (Peach, Toad and Yoshi), medium karts (Mario and Luigi) and heavy karts (DK, Wario and Bowser), where it is common sense to say that the lighter ones have higher acceleration and the heavier ones have a higher speed; the medium ones are considered karts intermediaries.
{: .text-justify}
But, is it really that? Why Yoshi is from the light class and not from average class? Are Wario and Bowser the same? You probably never asked yourself these things before, but I asked myself and decided to investigate!
{: .text-justify}
To try to figure this out, we need to have some measurements for each kart. After a search on the internet, I found on [this site](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/n64/197860-mario-kart-64 / faqs / 27391) some features of each player. The features are:
{: .text-justify}
1. Time (s) required to reach 30 km/h;
2. Time (s) required to reach 50 km/h;
3. Maximum speed (km/h);
4. Time (s) required to reach maximum speed.

Unfortunately, I did not find information on the handling of each kart, which it would be important information for the analysis that we are going to do. The data is shown in Table 1.

Table 1 â€“ Characteristics of each of the players in the Mario Kart 64 game.

| Player | TimeTo30kmph (s) |	TimeTo50kmph (s) |	TopSpeed (kmph) |	TimeToTopSpeed (kmph) |	WeightClass |
| :--- | :---: |	:---: |	:---: |	:---: |	:---: |
| Peach | 1.1 |	2.0 |	68 |	3.8 |	Light |
| Toad | 0.8 |	2.2 |	66 |	3.8 |	Light |
| Yoshi | 1.0 |	2.4 |	66 |	3.2 |	Light |
| Mario | 2.1 | 3.3	| 68	| 5.1	| Medium |
| Luigi	| 1.8	| 3.5	| 68	| 5.3	| Medium |
| Donkey Kong	| 2.0	| 2.6	| 70	| 4.2	| Heavy |
| Wario	| 2.0	| 2.7	| 70	| 4.0	| Heavy |
| Bowser	| 2.1	| 2.5	| 70	| 3.5	| Heavy |

When we look at the time to reach 30 km/h, we see a very clear difference between light and medium or heavy karts. But this characteristic is the same or is very confused between medium and heavy karts.
{: .text-justify}
As for the time to reach 50 km/h, we can see a difference between medium and heavy karts, where medium karts take longer to reach 50 km/h. Based on these data, we can say that light karts are the ones that accelerate faster at lower speeds.
When looking at the time needed to reach maximum speed, we see that the middle class is the slowest; however, the light and heavy classes overlapped. For example, look at Bowser that reaches maximum speed in less time than Toad and Peach, despite having a slower initial acceleration.
{: .text-justify}
Although it is possible to find some kind of pattern, as we saw through the maximum speed, in general, we don't have an obvious relationship between a kart being of the lightest class and accelerating faster and having a lower final speed, and it being heavier and then accelerating more slowly and have a higher final speed. In fact, we would even have something in that direction if it weren't for the middle class. But then, what characterizes a kart to be considered light, medium or heavy? Let's continue analyzing the data to try to find out.
{: .text-justify}
We could compare pairs of variables to try to find patterns more efficiently than just looking at numbers. An alternative is to several scatter plots (pair by pair) to try to find some kind of pattern, which can be seen in Figure 1.
