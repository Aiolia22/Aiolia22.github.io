## Resume

During the graduation in Food Engineering (UEM), I worked with the development of bakery products and sensory analysis (cookies and salted panettone), in addition to being a monitor in the unit operations discipline. I started my professional journey working in the quality area of a dairy industry, but I chose to deepen my knowledge through stricto sensu postgraduate courses. I have great experience with scientific research, having worked with mass transfer, specifically with the recovery of aromas from soluble coffee ([Master](https://acervodigital.ufpr.br/bitstream/handle/1884/30536/R - D - ANDERSON MARCOS DIAS CANTELI.pdf?sequence=1) in Food Engineering, UFPR) and effluent treatment ([Doctorate](https://acervodigital.ufpr.br/handle/1884/58189) in Food Engineering, UFPR), both using the adsorption process for mass exchange. I have experience in writing [articles](http://bit.ly/artigos_Canteli) and reports. I worked as a volunteer in several events, the most challenging being the IV Food Technology Round (2015). I have great knowledge in statistical analysis, especially through the response surface methodology, having given lectures (Unicesumar-PG), courses (Granotec), as well as several [tutorials](http://bit.ly/tutoriais_anderson) and [texts](https://bit.ly/pca_python) related to the topic. I have experience in MATLAB, R and mainly Python, having developed a Python computer program to evaluate experimental adsorption data (registered at INPI under the number [BR512019001440-5](https://gru.inpi.gov.br/pePI/servlet/ProgramaServletController?Action=detail&CodPedido=26470&SearchParameter=), which can be viewed in these [tutorials](https://youtu.be/N1elHsV4L1o)). I worked as a volunteer with the Núcleo de Estudos em Economia Social e Demográfica Econômica (Center for Studies in Social and Demographic Economic EconomicsNESDE) preparing time lapses to assist in the dissemination of COVID-19 information in the state of Paraná-Brazil, which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIQUuHawTgP_CspKZNnlow). The partnership with NESDE resulted in a [technical note](https://mfr.de-1.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/d539f/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render) regarding the strategies adopted by the Nordic countries regarding COVID-19, where all graphics and analyzes were done with Python well as some time lapses.
