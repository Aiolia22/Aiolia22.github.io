# Resume
During the graduation in Food Engineering (UEM), I worked with the
development of bakery products and sensory analysis (cookies and salted panettone), in
addition to being a monitor in the unit operations discipline. I started my professional
journey working in the quality area of a dairy industry, but I chose to deepen my
knowledge through stricto sensu postgraduate courses. I have great experience with
scientific research, having worked with mass transfer, specifically with the recovery of
aromas from soluble coffee ([Master](https://acervodigital.ufpr.br/bitstream/handle/1884/30536/R - D - ANDERSON MARCOS DIAS CANTELI.pdf?sequence=1) in Food Engineering, UFPR) and effluent treatment
(Doctorate in Food Engineering, UFPR), both using the adsorption process for mass
exchange. I have experience in writing articles and reports. I worked as a volunteer in
several events, the most challenging being the IV Food Technology Round (2015). I have
great knowledge in statistical analysis, especially through the response surface
methodology, having given lectures (Unicesumar-PG), courses (Granotec), as well as
several tutorials and texts related to the topic. I have experience in MATLAB, R and
mainly Python, having developed a Python computer program to evaluate experimental
adsorption data (registered at INPI under the number BR512019001440-5, which can be
viewed in these tutorials). I worked as a volunteer with the Núcleo de Estudos em
Economia Social e Demográfica Econômica (Center for Studies in Social and
Demographic Economic EconomicsNESDE) preparing time lapses to assist in the
dissemination of COVID-19 information in the state of Paraná-Brazil, which can be
viewed here. The partnership with NESDE resulted in a technical note regarding the
strategies adopted by the Nordic countries regarding COVID-19, where all graphics and
analyzes were done with Python s well as some time lapses.
