Sorry, but this page doesn't seem to exist. Or is it there?

In fact, there is a 50% chance that this page exists and a 50% chance that it does not exist,

This is a quantum page!


Anyway, this page was not found. Then you can try again or try another page.

<div id="text"></div>

var today = new Date();
var time = today.getHours();
var greet;

if (time > 18) {
  greet = 'Good evening babe!';
} else if (time > 12) {
  greet = 'Good afternoon Sir!';
} else if (time >= 0) {
  greet = 'text 1';
} else {
  greet = 'yo shits broken yo!';
}

<script>
document.getElementById("text").innerHTML = greet;

</script>
