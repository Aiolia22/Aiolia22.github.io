Sorry, but this page doesn't seem to exist. Or does it?

In fact, there is a 50% chance that this page exists and a 50% chance that this page it does not exist!

# This is a Schr√∂dinger's page!

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/GitHub-Mark.png" alt="cat" width="200" height="200">

<div id="text"></div>

<script>
var y = Math.floor((Math.random() * 2) + 1);
var greet;


if (y == 1) {
  greet = "This page is ALIVE!";
} else  {
  greet = "This page is DEAD!";
}
</script>

<script>
document.getElementById("text").innerHTML = greet;
</script>
