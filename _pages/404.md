Sorry, but this page doesn't seem to exist.


### Or does it?

<br />

In fact, there is a 50% chance that this page exists and a 50% chance that this page it does not exist!

## Details:

This is a page that simulates Schrodinger's experiment. The experiment is done as follows:
I stored this page (which corresponds to the cat) in a closed repository (which after closed has no contact with the outside world), and on this page there is an algorithm that choose a single number between the number 1 and the number 2.
If the draw returns the number 1, the page will be considered as existing.
If the draw returns number 2, the page will be considered non-existent.
This algorithm simulates the entire apparatus that Schrodinger proposed:
- A vessel with radioactive material, which has exactly a 50% chance of decay;
- A Geiger meter to check if the radioactive material decays;
- A vessel containing an amount of Cyanide;
- A hammer that will only be triggered if the Geiger meter identifies the radioactive material. If this happens, the hammer will break the vessel with Cyanide, which would kill the cat.

The problem is that until this page is loaded (which would correspond to the collapse system), it is not possible to know if this page exists or if it does not exist.
The moment the page is loaded (which simulates the observer opening the box to check the status of the cat), the random function will be called and the result will be displayed, which will collapse the page into a state of existing or not existing.

For this reason, this is a quantum page =D

*The content on this page is inspired by Schoridnger's theoretical experiment.*
